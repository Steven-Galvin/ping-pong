#### By Steven Galvin

## Description

With this basic web app the user can input any positive integer and my website will display all numbers from one to the number they chose. The only difference is that all numbers divisible by three will be replaced with the word "ping!", all numbers divisible by five will be replaced with "pong!", and all numbers divisible by 15 will be replaced with "ping-pong!". Here is a link to the github pages for this app https://steven-galvin.github.io/ping-pong/

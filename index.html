      <h2>Wanna Play Ping Pong?</h2>
      <p>This is a simple game, but it's not like the traditional form of ping pong. Unlike the one you may know, this one is a numbers game. With this simple web app, you can give me any postive integer and I will return you every number between one and the number you chose. There are a few rules to this game though.</p>
      <p id="rules">The three rules are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All numbers divisible by three will be replaced with the word "Ping!"</li>
        <li>All numbers divisible by five will be replaced with the word "Pong!"</li>
        <li>All numbers divisible by 15 will be replaced with the word "Ping-pong!"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And that's that! If you are ready to play, just pick a number, any number, and prepare to be amazed!</p>

      <form>
        <div class="form-group">
          <label for="userInput">Enter any postive integer:</label>
          <input id="userInput" class="form-control" type="text">
        </div>
        <button type="submit" class="btn">Ping-pong!</button>
      </form>
      <div class="output">
